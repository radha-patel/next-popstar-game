(each line is for a measure, so 16 sixteenth notes)
my heart's a stereo
it beats for you so listen close
hear my thoughts in every note
oh-oh, make me your radio
and turn me up when you feel low
this melody was meant for you,
just sing along to my stereo.

my heart's a stereo
it beats for you so listen close

oh-oh, make me your radio
and turn me up when you feel low
this melody was meant for you,
just sing along to my stereo.

Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh
oh-oh, To my stereo, 
Oh oh-oh oh-oh
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh, I only pray you never
Leave me behind,
Because good music can be
so hard to find,
I take your hand and hold it
closer to mine,
Thought love was dead, But now you're 
Changing my mind,

my heart's a stereo
it beats for you so listen close
hear my thoughts in every note
oh-oh, make me your radio
and turn me up when you feel low
this melody was meant for you,
just sing along to my stereo.

Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh
oh-oh, To my stereo, 
Oh oh-oh oh-oh
Just sing along to my stereo
