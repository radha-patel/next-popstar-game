# Who Will Be The Next Popstar?
## Overview 
In _Who Will be the Next Popstar?_, users play a series of minigames to test their dancing, singing, and rhythmical prowess and receive scores that represent their musical ability. The minigames include a Just Dance-esque game in which different steps are depicted on an LCD screen in sequence that the user has to then copy in time; a karaoke game where the objective is for the user to sing as closely to the original recording as possible; and finally, a rhythm game in which users will receive a unique sequence of buttons/actions to hit in time with music and will be scored based on the timing of the moves. The scoreboard for all players is visible on a self-refreshing website along with playing instructions. The purpose of this project is to help individuals overcome their inhibitions and anxiety towards musical performance as well as relieve stress from the associated endorphin rush.
